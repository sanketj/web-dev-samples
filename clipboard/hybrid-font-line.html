            During that period, which commenced after the disaster at Majuba Hill, "equal rights" were a golden
            dream which only the most optimistic ever hoped to see realized. From then onwards, as old colonists
            have so often told me, the Boers brought up the younger generation in the belief that the "Roinek" was
            a coward, and in consequence their arrogance in the country districts became wellnigh intolerable, while
            at the Cape the Bond party grew so strong it bid fair to elbow out the English altogether.
