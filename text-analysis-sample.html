This year, the 70th anniversary of Allied victory in World War II, warbirds are flying demonstrations in towns and cities across the country, including a flyover of the National Mall in Washington D.C. on May 8. If you’ve never heard a Merlin engine growl or seen a B-17 fly a stately pass across an airfield, this is the summer to do it.
Today, over 42,000 planes take flight in the U.S. every day, with 5,000 in the sky at any given time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Coordinating that many arrivals, departures and flights without collisions requires masterful planning, particularly when it comes to how high planes fly.
One reason that planes cruise above the clouds is so they can fly fast. The higher airplanes climb, the thinner the air gets, and the more efficiently they can fly because of less resistance in the atmosphere, according to Ryan Jorgenson.
Commercial aircraft typically fly around 38,000 feet — about 5.9 to 7.2 miles — high and usually reach their cruising altitudes in the first 10 minutes of a flight.</div></body>
