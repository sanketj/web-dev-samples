        <p>The above words, written by one of the greatest philosophers of olden time, have often impressed
            me, and I have frequently quoted them when asked why I did not write an account of the interesting travels
            and adventures I have had in my life. It has therefore required a great deal of courage to take up my
            pen and record a few recollections of South Africa. I felt that, were they ever to be written at all,
            it must be before the rapidly passing years diminish the interest in that land, which in the past has
            been the object of such engrossing attention; and that at the present time, when the impending Federation
            of South Africa has at length crowned the hopes of those patriots who have laboured patiently and hopefully
            to bring about this great result, it might be appropriate to recall those days when Englishmen, who had
            made South Africa their home, had much to contend with, even before the fierce struggle to keep "the flag
            flying" in the years of 1899-1902.</p>
