        <div contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.
NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the US space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most American space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
In 2018, Business Insider surveyed approximately 1,000 US residents to determine what they believed was the annual NASA budgets. The average respondent estimated that NASA's budget was 6.4% of annual federal spending, when it was actually 0.5%. In the answer to a follow up question, 85% of respondents stated that NASA funding should be increased, despite the majority of responses overestimating NASA's actual budget.
