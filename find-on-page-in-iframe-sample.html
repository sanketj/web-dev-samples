        <div>Authors can build custom highlights using either Ranges or StaticRanges.
The resulting custom highlight represents the same parts of the document, and can be styled identically.
However, the behavior is different in case the underlying document is modified.
Ranges are live ranges.
The user agent will adjust the boundary points of Ranges in response to DOM changes overlapping the range or at its boundary, and repaint accordingly.
Boundary points of live ranges can also be changed by the author.
On the other hand, the user agent must not adjust the boundary points of StaticRanges in response to DOM changes, nor can they be modified by the author after creation.
